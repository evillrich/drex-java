# Amp - Business AI Workspace Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Amp** is an open source Business AI Workspace designed for business professionals who need AI-powered document analysis with local processing and privacy control. Built on multi-provider AI technology, Amp provides a single-project workspace for organizing documents, interacting with AI agents across multiple providers, and executing custom business workflows with precision tools that exceed general LLM capabilities.

**Key Differentiators**: Multi-provider AI support, desktop-first document processing with local privacy, business-friendly version control, and custom workflow automation for accounting, legal, and consulting professionals.

## Vision & Value Proposition

Transform how small business professionals work with documents by providing a workspace environment that combines:

- **Universal AI Access**: Choose the best AI provider for each task (Claude for analysis, Gemini for speed)
- **Local Document Processing**: Desktop-first approach with sensitive document privacy and native performance
- **Custom Automation**: Define business processes in natural language that execute multi-step workflows
- **Business-Friendly Version Control**: Checkpoint system that prevents AI overwrites without Git complexity
- **Open Source Foundation**: Community-driven development with optional commercial services

**Product Strategy**:

- **Open Source Core**: Full-featured workspace with single-project focus, multi-provider AI, custom commands
- **Community-Driven Growth**: Discord/GitHub-based sharing of custom workflows and tools

## Risks & Validation Strategy

### Critical Technical Risks

**1. Document Rendering & Basic Editing (Make-or-Break Risk)**
- **Challenge**: Business users expect pixel-perfect document fidelity AND ability to make quick edits without constantly switching applications
- **User Expectations**:
    - Perfect rendering of complex tables, charts, formatting in Word/Excel/PowerPoint documents
    - Basic editing capabilities (text changes, cell edits, annotations) without leaving Amp
    - Seamless handoff to native applications when needed
- **Technical Reality**: Building even basic editing for Office formats is enormously complex; Microsoft's formats are intentionally difficult to replicate
- **Risk Impact**: Poor rendering or lack of editing will force constant app-switching, killing the workflow value proposition
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Focus on perfect read-only rendering first with smart "Open in native app" integration
    - Implement file watching for automatic re-import after external edits
    - Consider progressive enhancement: launch with viewing, add limited editing incrementally
    - Test with real business documents (financial statements, contracts, presentations) from day one

**2. AI Agent Response Speed (Business User Tolerance Risk)**
- **Challenge**: Business users have different speed expectations than developers; current AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini) are often slow for complex document analysis
- **User Expectations**:
    - Google Docs: Instant text editing
    - Excel: Immediate calculations
    - Professional tools: <2 second response times for routine operations
- **Current Reality**: Claude API responses: 5-30+ seconds for complex document analysis; multiple round trips even slower
- **Risk Impact**: If AI analysis feels slow compared to manual workflows, users will abandon the tool regardless of accuracy benefits
- **Speed Optimization Strategies**:
    - Aggressive local caching of document analysis results
    - Streaming responses with progress indicators and partial results
    - Smart preprocessing: pre-analyze documents, cache summaries/extractions
    - Background processing: queue longer analyses, allow continued work
    - Provider optimization: route speed-sensitive tasks to fastest models
- **UX Mitigations**:
    - Clear progress indicators: "Analyzing 5 documents... 60% complete"
    - Partial results: "Initial findings ready, full analysis in progress"
    - Realistic expectations: "Deep document analysis takes 30-60 seconds"

### Secondary Technical Risks

- **Checkpoint System Usability**: Business users must find version control intuitive and reliable
- **Multi-Provider Complexity**: Seamless provider switching without overwhelming non-technical users
- **Local Performance**: Desktop application must feel faster than web alternatives

### Market Risks

- **Open Source Adoption**: Community growth and engagement without traditional marketing spend
- **Custom Command Usability**: Non-technical users must successfully create and manage workflows
- **Desktop Application Preference**: Validating that target market prefers desktop over web applications
- **Community Platform Selection**: Finding where target business professionals actually congregate online (likely not GitHub)

### Validation Checkpoints

- **Week 1**: Document rendering quality validation with real business documents (financial statements, contracts, presentations) from target users
- **Week 2**: Speed tolerance testing - measure current manual workflow times vs. AI analysis expectations
- **Week 4**: Basic editing requirements validation - what editing capabilities are truly required vs. nice-to-have
- **Week 6**: Business-friendly checkpoint system usability testing with target users
- **Week 8**: End-to-end workflow speed testing with realistic document sets and AI analysis tasks
- **Week 12**: Community platform research - identify where target business professionals actually discuss tools and workflows
- **Week 16**: Beta testing with 10+ target users focusing on document quality and speed acceptance
